<h1>About the project</h1>
<!-- <br></br> -->
<p>This is a facial recognition model. This model detects faces and extract features from that detected faces and use that features to recognise them in data set</p>
<h2><u>Salient feature of this model:</u></h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>This model can work on small datasets:-</strong></li>
    <li><strong>This model can gather information of unknown faces:-</strong></li>
    <li><strong>This model can work on multiple faces:-</strong></li>
    <li><strong>This model can work on any lightning condition:-</strong></li>
</ul>
